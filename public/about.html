                                Still Life, Live Data – a new research by Shenkar College, the Inspire Lab for

                                Image Research, and the Sorbonne – will be presented in simultaneous

                                exhibitions and a symposium at the Artists Residence in Herzliya and the

                                Edmond de Rothschild Center in Tel Aviv.

                                </br>
                                </br>

                                The 1990s saw the disappearance of printed photographs from our lived

                                environment, as they wandered off to the virtual world. The research and exhibitions

                                address the relationship between the viewer, the artwork and the viewing space –

                                whether digital or physical.</br>

                                The exhibition is part of a unique collaboration between artist and Sorbonne

                                Professor Olga Kisseleva, researcher and artist Tsila Hassine (Sorbonne, Shenkar),

                                the Inspire Lab for Image Research and students from the departments of software

                                engineering, multidisciplinary art and visual communication at Shenkar.

                                The exhibition displays a dynamic viewing space that changes with the visitor’s gaze.

                                The interaction between each photo and its viewer transforms the relationships

                                between the photographs and shapes the experience of subsequent viewers.

                                The exhibition presents 13 photos from Kisseleva’s series Divers Faits [sic]. The

                                space is monitored by an IT system that measures the number of visitors and the

                                time they dedicate to viewing each piece. According to the data gathered by the

                                system in real time, the lighting and sound system of each photo is modified. The

                                more viewers spend more time viewing the photo, the more it is lighted and the

                                clearer the story behind it. The system is also programmed to form interrelations by

                                manipulating the allocation of light and sound among the photos. One of the

                                objectives of this modification is to raise the visitors’ awareness of their own impact

                                on the light and sound hierarchy.</br>

                                The research project and exhibition are simultaneously on display at the Artists

                                Residence in Herzliya and Gallery Rothschild 104 in Tel Aviv, as well as on a

                                dedicated website. Each venue offers a different local version of the interaction

                                between the viewer and the viewed.</br>

                                Olga Kisseleva is an international artist and the Head of the Art and Media

                                Laboratory at University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. Her research addresses

                                changes in recent culture with particular focus on the accelerated digitization

                                processes, and challenges the unbearable lightness of contemporary

                                connectedness. Her works were previously exhibited at the Jerusalem Science

                                Museum, the Tel Aviv Center for Contemporary Art (CCA), the Berlin transmediale,

                                The Inspire Lab for Image Research was established in Shenkar in order to delve

                                deeper into issues related to the interrelations between image and photo, and

                                between technologies and interfaces and those who design and operate them. The

                                lab is home to academics, scholars, artists, designers, engineers, industrialists and

                                artists engaged in both theoretical and practical research.</br>
